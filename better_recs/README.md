# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

This project is an attempt to showcase the ability of coders to create better, more complex features that give the user of social media applications more control over how they experience their feeds.

### Tech Stack Information

- FE: React Native using Expo written in TypeScript (stronly typed JavaScript)
- BE: Appwrite database, authentication, and storage services

### Known Issues

- Appwrite package ID is different from Expo's bundle ID as seen in [`app.json`](./app.json) under "ios". This isn't causing functional problems, but it's better practice to have the IDs match to avoid confusion.

### Using TypeScript

Causes extra work for definition of functions with props, common when creating custom components, or using hooks. Prevents runtime type errors, so worth it. Finagling needed to set types after-the-fact.

# Notes

## Seperating screens for (auth)

This is done because the figma designs have a navbar for authenticated users and no navbar for onboarding/login screens. This separation is good for things like this.

## .tsx vs .jsx (typescript vs javascript)

Only ran into issues with component creation. Need to add types after adding props to a component. GitHub CoPilot is most useful
for this, struggling to find other uses for CoPilot.

## React Navigation and Expo Routing

Still struggling to fully understand this, but it appears that routing is as simple as creating a stack with all the main screens
in the app and (....) folders to hold layouts for more complex screens.
